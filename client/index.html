    This product is a WIP. There are still a lot things to be done.
    The current version of the software is not meant to be already daily-driven
    in schools or companies.

    TODO: 
    - Master relative positioning on screen (Maybe Font mastering?)
    - Design account System (login and password) to prevent abuse
